# Engine

Engine is a collection of low level transport protocols implemented in pure Swift intended for use in server side and client side applications. It is used as the core transport layer in [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/github).

##### [Engine](#httpclient)
HTTP and Stream layers

##### [WebSockets](#websockets)
Realtime websockets

##### [SMTP](#smtp-1)
Send emails.

## Quick Start

#### HTTPClient

```Swift
import Engine

let response = try HTTPClient<TCPClientStream>.get("http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/")
print(response)
```

#### HTTPServer

```Swift
import Engine

final class Responder: HTTPResponder {
    func respond(to request: HTTPRequest) throws -> HTTPResponse {
        let body = "Hello World".makeBody()
        return HTTPResponse(body: body)
    }
}

let server = try HTTPServer<TCPServerStream, HTTPParser<HTTPRequest>, HTTPSerializer<HTTPResponse>>(port: port)

print("visit http://localhost:\(port)/")
try server.start(responder: Responder()) { error in
    print("Got error: \(error)")
}
```

#### WebSocket Client

```Swift
import Engine
import WebSockets

try WebSocket.connect(to: url) { ws in
    print("Connected to \(url)")

    ws.onText = { ws, text in
        print("[event] - \(text)")
    }

    ws.onClose = { ws, _, _, _ in
        print("\n[CLOSED]\n")
    }
}
```

#### WebSocket Server

```Swift
import Engine
import WebSockets

final class Responder: HTTPResponder {
    func respond(to request: HTTPRequest) throws -> HTTPResponse {
        return try request.upgradeToWebSocket { ws in
            print("[ws connected]")

            ws.onText = { ws, text in
                print("[ws text] \(text)")
                try ws.send("üéô \(text)")
            }

            ws.onClose = { _, code, reason, clean in
                print("[ws close] \(clean ? "clean" : "dirty") \(code?.description ?? "") \(reason ?? "")")
            }
        }
    }
}

let server = try HTTPServer<TCPServerStream, HTTPParser<HTTPRequest>, HTTPSerializer<HTTPResponse>>(port: port)

print("Connect websocket to http://localhost:\(port)/")
try server.start(responder: Responder()) { error in
    print("Got server error: \(error)")
}
```

#### SMTP

```Swift
import SMTP

let credentials = SMTPCredentials(
    user: "server-admin-login",
    pass: "secret-server-password"
)

let from = EmailAddress(name: "Password Reset",
                        address: "noreply@myapp.com")
let to = "some-user@random.com"
let email: Email = Email(from: from,
                         to: to,
                         subject: "Vapor SMTP - Simple",
                         body: "Hello from Vapor SMTP üëã")

let client = try SMTPClient<TCPClientStream>.makeGmailClient()
try client.send(email, using: credentials)
```

## Architecture

#### HTTPServer

The HTTPServer is responsible for listening and accepting remote connections, then relaying requests and responses between the received connection and the responder.

#### HTTPClient

The HTTPClient is responsible for establishing remote connections and relaying requests and responses between the remote connection and the caller.
