        3.2.2.  Field Order

        The order in which header fields with differing field names are
        received is not significant.  However, it is good practice to send
        header fields that contain control data first, such as Host on
        requests and Date on responses, so that implementations can decide
        when not to handle a message as early as possible.  A server MUST NOT
        apply a request to the target resource until the entire request



        Fielding & Reschke           Standards Track                   [Page 23]

        RFC 7230           HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing         June 2014


        header section is received, since later header fields might include
        conditionals, authentication credentials, or deliberately misleading
        duplicate header fields that would impact request processing.

        A sender MUST NOT generate multiple header fields with the same field
        name in a message unless either the entire field value for that
        header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]
        or the header field is a well-known exception (as noted below).

        A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field
        name into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the
        semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value to
        the combined field value in order, separated by a comma.  The order
        in which header fields with the same field name are received is
        therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field
        value; a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when
        forwarding a message.

         Note: In practice, the "Set-Cookie" header field ([RFC6265]) often
         appears multiple times in a response message and does not use the
         list syntax, violating the above requirements on multiple header
         fields with the same name.  Since it cannot be combined into a
         single field-value, recipients ought to handle "Set-Cookie" as a
         special case while processing header fields.  (See Appendix A.2.3
         of [Kri2001] for details.)
